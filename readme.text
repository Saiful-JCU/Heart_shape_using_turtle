let's go through the code line by line:

1. `import math`: This line imports the math module, which provides mathematical functions.
2. `from turtle import *`: This line imports all symbols from the `turtle` module into the current namespace, allowing you to use them without prefixing with `turtle.`.
3. `def hearta(k):`: This line defines a function named `hearta` that takes one parameter `k`.
4. `return 15*math.sin(k)**3`: This line returns a value calculated using a mathematical expression involving the sine function.
5. `def heartb(k):`: This line defines a function named `heartb` that takes one parameter `k`.
6. `return 12*math.cos(k)-5*\
    math.cos(2*k)-2*\
    math.cos(3*k)-\
    math.cos(4*k)`: This line returns a value calculated using a mathematical expression involving the cosine function.
7. `speed(1000)`: This line sets the speed of the turtle to 1000, which is the maximum speed. This makes the turtle move more quickly when drawing.
8. `bgcolor("black")`: This line sets the background color of the drawing window to black.
9. `for x in range(6500):`: This line starts a loop that iterates 6500 times. The variable `x` takes on values from 0 to 6499.
10. `goto(hearta(x)*20, heartb(x)*20)`: This line moves the turtle to the position specified by the `hearta` and `heartb` functions, scaled by a factor of 20.
11. `for y in range(10):`: This line starts a loop that iterates 10 times. The variable `y` takes on values from 0 to 9.
12. `color('red')`: This line sets the color of the turtle pen to red.
13. `goto(0,0)`: This line moves the turtle back to the origin (0, 0).
14. `done()`: This line finishes the turtle graphics, allowing the window to stay open and display the drawing.

Overall, this code draws a heart-shaped curve using Turtle graphics, with a red color, on a black background. The heart shape is defined by the `hearta` and `heartb` functions, which use mathematical expressions involving trigonometric functions.
